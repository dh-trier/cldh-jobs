MODELING AND OPTIMIZATION IN CONNECTION WITH STOCHASTICS IS YOUR TOPIC? THE DEPARTMENT »OPTIMIZATION« AT FRAUNHOFER INSTITUTE FOR INDUSTRIAL MATHEMATICS (ITWM) IS OFFERING A DIVERSIFIED EMPLOYMENT AS PhD Student for »Optimization under Uncertainties« The optimization department of the Fraunhofer ITWM develops individual solutions for planning and decision support for problems in logistics, engineering / natural sciences and life sciences in close collaboration with researchers and industrial customers. There, a close integration of modeling, simulation, optimization and decision support is realized. We are looking for a PhD student in mathematics for the topic »Solving mixed stochastic-robust optimization problems via semi-infinite optimization«. The PhD project is co-supervised by PD Dr. René Henrion, research group „Nonlinear Optimization and Inverse Problems“, Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics (WIAS), Berlin. In detail, the following tasks shall be addressed within the framework of the PhD project:
reformulation of mixed stochastic-robust optimization problems as semi-infinite optimization problems and investigation of these with respect to their structural properties
adaptation of methods of semi-infinite optimization or development of new methods for solving mixed stochastic-robust optimization problems modeling and solving of application problems as mixed stochastic-robust ones
What we expect from you
superior university degree in (applied) mathematics with relevant recess in nonlinear optimization, probability theory, or functional analysis
competence in numeric and scientific computing
advanced programming knowledge (Matlab and/or C/C++/C#)
independent and goal-oriented working
willingness to familiarize oneself with new issues as well as to implement models and concepts in algorithms and software
willingness to present the results in German and English at national and international conferences as well as to research stays at the WIAS in Berlin
What you can expect from us
an exciting PhD topic in applied research
lively exchange with experts from the relevant areas
a flexible, innovative and creative environment
time to learn, research and develop your personality
